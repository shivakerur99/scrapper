Haven't sorted out how to get a perfect xls file from their CSVs (for LinkedIn Sales Nav search lists) but I'm in touch with one of the people at Wiza. The response speed is not so fast, though the Chrome plug-in seems to be doing its job well. It's just that many of my leads don't have an email address, not even on Lusha or Wiza, quite disappointing if you pay money for this."

Shared with your team.WhenX helps you to find previously visited links in your Google‚Ñ¢ search results by adding a tag with your last visit time next to the link! No need to go searching through your history or open up countless links in search of the correct one. Hovering over the tag will give you a more detailed stamp with specifics of the date and time of your last visit.\n\nIt helps you re-find webpages you visited before and gives you a time context about when you searched for certain topics. \n\n\nFEATURES\nüîç Re-find websites\nInstead of bookmarking every page you might need in the future, timestamps help you identify webpages you have seen before, when you search for them.\n\nüö´ Avoid irrelevant links\nA timestamp with a recent date like 'yesterday' or '8 hours ago' helps you avoid opening pages you recently explored, hence saves time reopening them.\n\n‚èÆÔ∏è Retrospective\nTimestamps appear for links visited before installation.\n\nüîí Keeps your privacy\nWhenX uses your local browser history, locally.

Haven't sorted out how to get a perfect xls file from their CSVs (for LinkedIn Sales Nav search lists) but I'm in touch with one of the people at Wiza. The response speed is not so fast, though the Chrome plug-in seems to be doing its job well. It's just that many of my leads don't have an email address, not even on Lusha or Wiza, quite disappointing if you pay money for this."

Haven't sorted out how to get a perfect xls file from their CSVs (for LinkedIn Sales Nav search lists) but I'm in touch with one of the people at Wiza. The response speed is not so fast, though the Chrome plug-in seems to be doing its job well. It's just that many of my leads don't have an email address, not even on Lusha or Wiza, quite disappointing if you pay money for this."

No need to go searching through your history or open up countless links in search of the correct one. Hovering over the tag will give you a more detailed stamp with specifics of the date and time of your last visit.\n\nIt helps you re-find webpages you visited before and gives you a time context about when you searched for certain topics. \n\n\nFEATURES\nüîç Re-find websites\nInstead of bookmarking every page you might need in the future, timestamps help you identify webpages you have seen before, when you search for them.\n\nüö´ Avoid irrelevant links\nA timestamp with a recent date like 'yesterday' or '8 hours ago' helps you avoid opening pages you recently explored, hence saves time reopening them.\n\n‚èÆÔ∏è Retrospective\nTimestamps appear for links visited before installation.\n\nüîí Keeps your privacy\nWhenX uses your local browser history, locally.

Every time you start the dux there is an issue, it stops automatically, and I have to delete and reinstall it every day. Service from the company is very poor when you ask them for help. Always so many instructions to follow but all leads to the same place. Nowhere. I am using it but will probably look for an alternative soon. Yes it does generate loads of leads, but its annoying at the same time"

Every time you start the dux there is an issue, it stops automatically, and I have to delete and reinstall it every day. Service from the company is very poor when you ask them for help. Always so many instructions to follow but all leads to the same place. Nowhere. I am using it but will probably look for an alternative soon.

Every time you start the dux there is an issue, it stops automatically, and I have to delete and reinstall it every day. Service from the company is very poor when you ask them for help. Always so many instructions to follow but all leads to the same place. Nowhere. I am using it but will probably look for an alternative soon. Yes it does generate loads of leads, but its annoying at the same time"
