They can also write entire emails based on a few keywords.\nSimply open ChatGPT, ask it to write your email and copy paste the content into a Gmail draft. You can even indicate that you are running a mail merge campaign and give it merge tags to include in the draft.\n \n————————————————————————————————\n🔒SECURITY\nMost of your data never leaves your Google account (your list of recipients stay in your spreadsheets, your email content stays in Gmail™). \nPlease read the Data Access & Data Storage sections of our Privacy Policy to learn more.\nhttps://www.mergo.app/privacy-policy\nWe also go through a security assessment once a year (by firms like Bishopfox and NCC Group). \nThis assessment helps keep Google users’ data safe by verifying that Mergo demonstrates capability in handling data securely and deleting user data upon user request.\nhttps://help.mergo.app/article/95-mergos-security-assessment\n\n————————————————————————————————\n🤔 Why use Mergo instead of its competitors?\nMany apps are available on the Google Workspace Marketplace to send email campaigns. \nMergo is the first one entirely built on the new generation of Google add-ons: all the code running in your web browser is served and secured by Google (no custom HTML or Javascript with potential security threat, no hack of the Gmail™ user interface like Gmass does).\nSome, like Mailmeteor, are not as integrated as Mergo with Gmail™. They can’t use Gmail™ drafts, can’t track responses and can’t perform follow-ups in the same email threads.\n\n————————————————————————————————\nUSE CASES\nNot convinced yet? Here are a few examples of email campaigns you can send with Mergo:\n➤ Lead generation campaigns: Import contacts from your Google Contacts or from your preferred CRM in a .CSV format file (Salesforce, HubSpot, Copper …) into your Google Sheets. Use Mergo to send well-targeted emails to your prospects, so you don’t miss any potential customers!\n➤ Sales prospecting emails: Account managers will love the simplicity of Mergo to send personalized emails to their target and easily manage their portfolio of clients. It’s much easier to use than Salesforce List Emails, Pardot, HubSpot, MailChimp, SendGrid, GetResponse or MailerLite.\n➤ Event invitations: Make sure your guests get the right invitation at the right time using Mergo’s personalized attachments and scheduling features. Send invitations to corporate events, weddings, meet-ups, product launch events, seminars, festivals, fairs, job-datings and more!\n➤ Promotions: Discounts can be a very powerful customer acquisition and retention tool, so you don’t want to miss this opportunity! Send coupons and discounts during summer/winter sales, Black Fridays, first-time purchases ...\n➤ Newsletters / Marketing campaigns: Send regular newsletters on your product and services, and track who opened, clicked and responded to your emails. Remove bounces from your list, and improve your next campaign to increase customer engagement.\n➤ Customer satisfaction surveys: Improve your business and processes by getting meaningful feedback from your customers.\n➤ Internal communications: Streamline all your communications between managers and employees, HR and teams, administration and parents, teachers and students ... Add the relevant people as CC or BCC recipients to your email so nobody misses important information.\n➤ Greetings emails: Send Christmas wishes, Happy New Year, Thanksgiving, holiday greetings, birth announcements, thank-you emails etc. to your friends, family, colleagues, associations’ members ...\n➤ Media campaigns: Send a PR campaign to journalists, bloggers, influencers to raise awareness on your product.\n➤ Reminder campaigns: Send a monthly reminder to your employees to ask them to register their expenses in your CRM solution.\n\n————————————————————————————————\n🆕 RELEASE NOTES (not 100% up to date, sorry! 🙇):\n📅 2022\nJanuary: Mergo automatically adjusts the delivery speed to increase deliverability (it can take more time to send your campaign but you are less likely to end up in spam)\n\n📅 2021\nNovember: Added a domain template gallery to share email templates with your colleagues\nSeptember: Automatically send follow-up emails to recipient who did not respond, inside the same email thread\nJuly: Import your recipients from a Microsoft Excel or CSV file\nJune: Send email campaigns directly from Gmail™ and from Google Docs\nMay: Added ability to repeat a campaign every week / month / year (to send a reminder, happy birthday,...)\nApril: Compatibility with Zapier and similar tools: send a mail when a new row is added to your spreadsheet\nMarch: Turn Google Docs into Gmail™ drafts\nFebruary: Daily quotas are now up to 500 for Gmail™ accounts, and 2000 for Google Workspace accounts\nJanuary: Pause or Abort an ongoing campaign\n\n📅 2020\nDecember: HUGE! Mergo UI has been entirely rebuilt and is now part of the latest generation of Google Workspace add-ons (using the CardService for improved security and integration into Google Workspace)\nOctober: New scheduling option: \"row by row\", to send each row at a specific time\nSeptember: Emojis are now supported in both subject lines and body content\nAugust: You can now add a link to let your recipients unsubscribe from your campaigns\nJuly: Added scheduling options to send your campaign on a specific date / time\nJune: Added tracking feature: Open rate, click rate, response rate\nMay: Creation of Mergo: Send mass emails from Gmail™ and Google Sheets, email personalization option, cc/bcc recipients, import from Google Contacts, personalized attachments\n\nIf you like Mergo, please support us by giving us a 5-star rate or leaving a short review on this page! You may also want to try our other apps like Folgo (https://www.folgo.app/) and Publigo (https://www.publigo.app/).\n\nMergo was created by Romain Vialard, Scriptit. \nRomain is also the creator of Yet Another Mail Merge (YAMM), Awesome Table & Form Publisher.

Known simply as AI, this field integrates various technologies and methodologies to emulate intelligent behavior in machines. The phrase \"artificial AI\" highlights the synthetic nature of this intelligence, setting it apart from the innate intelligence of humans and animals.\n\nThe concept of artificial intelligence AI involves a broad spectrum of computing and cognitive science aimed at simulating human intelligence processes. This includes learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. In today's tech landscape, artificial intelligence and machine learning are intricately linked. Machine learning, a subset of AI, entails developing algorithms that enable machines to learn from data, leading to predictions or decisions. The interaction between artificial intelligence AI and machine learning has spearheaded many technological breakthroughs.\n\nThis synergy has revolutionized numerous sectors. In healthcare, AI algorithms assist in diagnosing diseases more accurately and quickly. In the automotive field, artificial intelligence AI is pivotal in developing autonomous vehicles. In finance, machine learning models are used for fraud detection and automated trading.\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) is its ability to solve complex problems that were once beyond the reach of conventional computing. AI algorithms are employed in climate modeling and astronomy to analyze vast data sets.\n\nYet, the rise of artificial AI poses challenges, particularly in ethics, privacy, security, and decision-making biases. As artificial intelligence AI progresses, addressing these concerns is critical for responsible technology use.\n\nAn exemplary application of AI's advancements is seen in tools like \"GPT Plus Docs for Google Docs™.\" This ultimate AI writing assistant transforms the Google Docs experience by seamlessly integrating powerful OpenAI models like Chat GPT 3.5 turbo, ChatGpt 4, ChatGpt 4-32k, and DALL E. GPT Plus Docs enhances writing tasks by summarizing articles, correcting grammar, generating images, and translating text, exemplifying the practical use of artificial intelligence AI and machine learning in everyday productivity tools.\n\nThe field of artificial intelligence and machine learning is continually evolving. The future of AI promises enhanced applications in natural language processing, advanced robotics, and predictive analytics. The integration of artificial intelligence AI and machine learning will undoubtedly remain a key driver of innovation, reshaping our daily lives and work in significant ways.\n\nFree Tokens:\nRegister on OpenAI's website to get free ChatGPT tokens (around 900k tokens).
